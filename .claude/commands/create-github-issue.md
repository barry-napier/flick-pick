# Create FlickPick GitHub Issue

## Introduction

Transform FlickPick roadmap items into well-structured GitHub issues tailored for multi-agent development. This command extracts context from project documentation, assigns appropriate agents, and ensures alignment with the 6-phase development workflow.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Access to the FlickPick repository
- Understanding of the roadmap item or feature to document

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

## Main Tasks

### 1. FlickPick Context Gathering

**Project Documentation Research:**

- [ ] Review `/docs/task-list.md` for phase alignment and deliverables
- [ ] Check `/CLAUDE.md` for technical specifications and architecture
- [ ] Examine `/docs/PRD.md` for product requirements and constraints
- [ ] Review existing codebase structure and patterns
- [ ] Check TMDB API integration requirements
- [ ] Analyze existing issues for FlickPick formatting patterns and labels

**Roadmap Context Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify which development phase (1-6) the issue belongs to:
  - Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Next.js, Prisma, TMDB API)
  - Phase 2: Core Features (Movie cards, swipe gestures, navigation)
  - Phase 3: Data & Recommendations (Device fingerprinting, algorithms)
  - Phase 4: Polish & Performance (Animations, error handling)
  - Phase 5: Testing & Security (Comprehensive QA, security audit)
  - Phase 6: Deployment & Launch (Production setup, monitoring)
- [ ] Determine lead and support agent assignments
- [ ] Identify Product Owner, Technical Architect, and UI/UX Designer review requirements
- [ ] Check for cross-phase dependencies and coordination needs

**Multi-Agent Coordination Research:**

- [ ] Identify primary agent responsible (lead)
- [ ] Determine supporting agents needed
- [ ] Note required handoff interfaces and deliverables
- [ ] Check for leadership agent approval requirements
- [ ] Document integration points with other agents' work

### 2. Agent Assignment & Coordination Planning

**Primary Agent Identification:**

- [ ] Assign lead agent based on expertise area:
  - `@agent-technical-architect` (System architecture, Next.js setup)
  - `@agent-nextjs-api-developer` (API routes, Prisma, TMDB integration)
  - `@agent-nextjs-ui-builder` (React components, swipe gestures, animations)
  - `@agent-ui-ux-designer` (Design system, accessibility, user experience)
  - `@agent-security-guardian` (Device fingerprinting, API security, privacy)
  - `@agent-testing-qa-engineer` (Unit tests, E2E, performance testing)
  - `@agent-product-owner` (Product strategy, requirements, prioritization)

**Leadership Agent Reviews:**

- [ ] Determine if `@agent-product-owner` approval required
- [ ] Check if `@agent-technical-architect` review needed
- [ ] Identify if `@agent-ui-ux-designer` review required

**Supporting Agent Coordination:**

- [ ] List supporting agents needed for implementation
- [ ] Define handoff requirements and interfaces
- [ ] Document integration testing needs
- [ ] Plan for cross-agent communication
