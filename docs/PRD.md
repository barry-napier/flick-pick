## 2. Problem Statement

### User Pain Points in Movie Discovery

#### Primary Problems
1. **Choice Overload**: Users spend 18+ minutes browsing streaming platforms before choosing what to watch
2. **Information Overwhelm**: Too many filters, ratings, and reviews create decision paralysis
3. **Stale Recommendations**: Algorithm-based suggestions become repetitive and predictable
4. **Multiple Platform Fragmentation**: Content scattered across different streaming services
5. **Lack of Social Discovery**: Limited ability to discover what others are enjoying

#### Market Opportunity
- **Market Size**: Global video streaming market valued at $463.4B in 2024
- **User Base**: 1.4B streaming subscribers worldwide experiencing discovery friction
- **Time Saved**: Average user spends 30+ minutes daily browsing for content

- **JustWatch**: Cross-platform search (overwhelming interface, no personalization)
- **Reelgood**: Universal watchlist (complex UI, limited discovery features)

#### Indirect Competitors
- **Netflix/Prime Video**: Native recommendation engines (platform-locked, algorithm fatigue)
- **IMDb**: Movie database (information-heavy, not discovery-focused)
- **Tinder**: Swipe mechanics (different vertical, proven engagement model)

#### Competitive Advantages
- **Unique Interaction Model**: First movie discovery app with Tinder-style swiping
- **Frictionless Onboarding**: No account required for core functionality
- **Cross-Platform Aggregation**: Content from all streaming services
